Create a Scandinavian-minimal design system with the following specifications:

## Typography
Use system font stack (SF Pro on iOS, Roboto on Android, system-ui fallback) for optimal platform consistency and readability.

## Color Palette (HSL values)
Primary sage green: hsl(140, 25%, 45%)
Primary green foreground: hsl(35, 25%, 98%)
Background: hsl(35, 20%, 98%) - warm cream
Card background: hsl(35, 25%, 96%) - soft cream  
Secondary: hsl(35, 30%, 92%) - light cream
Foreground text: hsl(160, 8%, 15%) - deep blue-gray
Muted text: hsl(160, 6%, 50%) - softer gray
Success green: hsl(120, 40%, 50%)
Accent: hsl(140, 20%, 90%) - very light sage
Border: hsl(35, 15%, 88%)

## Gradients
Primary: linear-gradient(135deg, hsl(140, 25%, 45%), hsl(140, 30%, 55%))
Soft: linear-gradient(180deg, hsl(35, 25%, 96%), hsl(35, 20%, 94%))
Warm: linear-gradient(45deg, hsl(35, 30%, 92%), hsl(140, 20%, 90%))

## Visual Style
- Border radius: 0.75rem for gentle, approachable feel
- Shadows: Soft, subtle elevation (0 2px 12px with low opacity)
- Spacing: Generous, systematic spacing system
- High contrast for accessibility (WCAG AA)
- Touch-friendly 44px minimum button sizes
- Clean, uncluttered layouts with ample whitespace

## Design Philosophy
Scandinavian minimal: functional, clean, family-friendly without being childish. Warm and welcoming atmosphere using muted, eye-friendly colors. Sage green incorporated subtly throughout for buttons, active states, and accents while maintaining the calm, natural aesthetic.
