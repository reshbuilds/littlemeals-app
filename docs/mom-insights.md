# Cooking Patterns & User Preferences

## Food Rotation Rules

- I don't repeat the same foods for at least 2 weeks
- I don't cook the same food daily, so weekly wins don't matter to me
- Fortnightly patterns work better - that's how I buy groceries
- If something worked in week 1, I'm certainly not cooking it in week 2
- I might cook week 1's foods in week 3 or 4 perhaps
- No hard and fast rule, but definitely no repetition

## Key Insights Preferences

- Weekly metrics are too short-term for my cooking cycle
- Fortnightly or monthly patterns are more relevant
- Focus on variety and rotation, not frequency
- Track what worked 2+ weeks ago for meal planning

## User Preferences & Customization

- The option to see weekly or 2+ weeks ago trends is chosen by the user and can be customized
- We need to ensure a way to get their preference somewhere without obstructing the flow of the app by making it user-friendly
- Preference should be easy to set but not intrusive to the main workflow
