## Testing Strategy for Each Task

**Every task includes two types of testing:**

### Implementation Testing (During Development)
- **Unit Tests:** Test individual components and functions
- **Integration Tests:** Test component interactions and API calls
- **Visual Tests:** Verify UI renders correctly on different devices

### User Acceptance Testing (After Development)
- **Manual Testing Workflows:** Step-by-step verification procedures
- **Real-World Scenarios:** Test with actual family data and usage patterns
- **Cross-Device Testing:** Verify functionality across iOS and Android

### Example Testing Structure:
**Task 5A: Build Main Meal Entry Form**

*Implementation Tests:*
- Unit test form validation logic
- Integration test food autocomplete API
- Visual test form rendering on different screen sizes

*Manual Testing Workflow:*
- Open meal logging screen
- Enter food name and verify autocomplete works
- Select date and meal type
- Verify form saves correctly
- Test error handling with invalid inputs

This granular approach ensures every feature works correctly before moving to the next task.
